# Neth
.Net Ethererum Client

## Why another client?
The 3 leading Ethereum clients are Geth, Eth and Parity.  

## Do we need another client?
Imo, the more clients, written in more lanaguages reduces centralisation and encourges more developers to contributes to the eco system.  There is alot of talent out there that cannot contribute meaningfully because of their languge of choice.

## What about NEthereum?
NEthereum is a .Net RPC wrapper that interfaces with a client like Geth.  A good test of the success of this project will be if Nethereum can interface with Neth!

## Design
A .Net, persistant ignorant client is to be developed.  The repository can use an "enterprise" database, such as Microsoft SQL Server.  This will also enable TSQL queries to be written against the Etherum block chain.

### Models

### Repositories
We will use the repository pattern

1. MS SQL
2. LiteDB
3. In Memory db, for testing
